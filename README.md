Run scripts from your Midi device.

## Why?

I use this for all kinds of reasons.

* A convenient way to trigger system functions during a music performance.
* A test-case laucher during software developement so that you don't need to change windows to trigger a curl script, or something along those lines.
* A ghetto sampler - triggering sounds with `afplay` or "vocals" with the `say` command.

More to the point, if you already have a Midi device sitting on your desk unused, why not use it for something?
